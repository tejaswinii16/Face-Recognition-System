# Face-Recognition-System
The "Face Recognition System" project is designed to create an advanced algorithm for identifying and verifying faces within images. Developed on MATLAB, the system utilizes its powerful capabilities for algorithm development, data analysis, and numeric computation. Employing tools like Image Acquisition, Image Processing, and Neural Network Toolboxes, the project explores various methods for face detection and recognition. The goal is to overcome challenges such as illumination changes, pose variations, and facial expressions. The project aims to provide an effective solution for accurate and reliable face recognition in diverse scenarios.
